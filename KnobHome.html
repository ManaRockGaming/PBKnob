                <p>
                    This is an unofficial website for the Freshman Class of 2025, from Palmetto Battery. This website has no official connection, recognition, or endorsement from the Citadel, the South Carolina Corp of Cadets, 5th Battalion, the Palmetto Battery, or any other organization. On this website you will find the contact information of all the knobs in Palmetto Battery, along with official and unofficial Palmetto Battery events. If you are a TAC, an employee of The Citadel, upperclassman, or knob from another company you can request access to this website from Cadet Recruit Rom (crom@citadel.edu). Cadet Recruit Rom will not share any information unless the situation is dire enough where people can be hurt, injured, or helped.

                    This website will be continually improving. If you want to help program this website or have an interesting idea, please email Cadet Recruit Rom at crom@citadel.edu. Some of the few things Cadet Recruit Rom want to add later to this website are: a visual map of the barracks, a print out knob list, and a list of every PB upperclassman (for after Parent's Weekend).
