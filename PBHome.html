                <p>
                    In Update 2.0, we added the flag roster and upperclassman names. In Update 3.0, Rom updated some minor bugs and errors after being pointed out by Upperclassman. In the future Update 4.0, Conor Rom plans to add a security password to the website, along with including the room numbers of all the upperclassmen. Possible also the intramural schedule. If you have any suggestions on how this website could be improved please tell Conor Rom.
